Provides support for Visual Basic 6.

TO-DO

# Why reviving the undead?
Because sometimes you have to deal with legacy code and that's bad enough to also suffering with incredibly old IDEs.

# How to run locally
* `npm install` to initialize the extension and the server
* `npm run compile` to compile the extension and the server
* open this folder in VS Code. In the Debug viewlet, run 'Launch Client' from drop-down to launch the extension and attach to the extension.
* create a file `test.txt`, and type `typescript`. You should see a validation error.
* to debug the server use the 'Attach to Server' launch config.
* set breakpoints in the client or the server.
